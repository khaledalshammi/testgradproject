--Forms--

use forms with user input
forms enable you to validate the inputs

each app has its own forms
Creat app

in your app create forms.py

build your form logic

login example:

from django import forms
class LoginForm(forms.Form):
    username = forms.CharField(label='Your username', max_length=150)
    password = forms.CharField(label='Your password', widget=forms.PasswordInput(attrs={'class': 'pt-2'}))

in previous example:
username is text field that has label and max length.
password is text field but we changed its widget to PasswordInput
to hide password content into stars (********). has its own class.


contact example:

from django import forms
class ContactForm(forms.Form):
    subject = forms.CharField(max_length=100)
    message = forms.CharField(widget=forms.Textarea)
    sender = forms.EmailField()
    attachment = forms.FileField(required=False)


register example included validation:
from django import forms
class RegisterForm(forms.Form):
    username = forms.CharField(label='Your username', max_length=150)
    email = forms.EmailField()
    password = forms.CharField(label='Your password', widget=forms.PasswordInput)
    confirm_password = forms.CharField(label='Confirm Your password', widget=forms.PasswordInput)

    def clean_email(self):
        email = self.cleaned_data['email']
        if User.objects.filter(email=email).exists():
            raise forms.ValidationError("This email is already associated with a user.")
        return email

    def clean(self):
    cleaned_data = super().clean()
    password = cleaned_data.get('password')
    confirm_password = cleaned_data.get('confirm_password')
    if password and confirm_password and password != confirm_password:
        raise forms.ValidationError("Passwords do not match.")
    return cleaned_data

Explanation:
cleaned_data: enable you to get the input value
forms.ValidationError: display error
clean_email function: we checked if the email is already bined with another user
clean function: we checked if password match the confirm_password
