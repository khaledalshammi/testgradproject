--Inheritance - Abstraction--
We use inheritance to reduce the replication
Example: assume we have 3 tables that used created at. 

class Car(models.Model):
    ...
    created_at = models.DateTimeField()
class Category(models.Model):
    ...
    created_at = models.DateTimeField()
class Product(models.Model):
    ...
    created_at = models.DateTimeField()

Instead of inserting created_at 3 times we can put it in separated models then we can inherit it.
Solution:
class CreatedAt(models.Model):
    created_at = models.DateTimeField()
class Car(CreatedAt):
class Category(CreatedAt):
class Product(CreatedAt):
Wow it's much better.
Car, Category and Product still have created_at = models.DateTimeField() but instead of repeating the same code 3 times.
We put it in separated Model then we inherit it.
In previous example it doesn't make sense to create object from CreatedAt so, we can unable creating object from it by using abstraction.
class CreatedAt(models.Model):
    created_at = models.DateTimeField()

    class Meta:
        abstract = True
