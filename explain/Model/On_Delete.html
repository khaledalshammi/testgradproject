--On Delete--
class Author(models.Model):
name = models.CharField(max_length=100)

class Book(models.Model):
title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete)

Each other could have multiple books, each book could be related to one author.
What will happen if author is deleted?
Will the books be deleted with author or it will not be related to the author or it will be bind with another author?
Your are the one who can decide what will happen.
You have 5 approaches.

CASCADE
author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
If the author is deleted. the related books will also be deleted.

SET_NULL
author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, null=True, blank=True)
If the author is deleted. the related books will not be binded to that author so the author field in book will be null.

PROTECT and RESTRICT
author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.PROTECT)
author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.RESTRICT)
If the author has related books. author can't be deleated until it become unrelated to any book so,
You won't be able to delete a Author as long as it has associated books objects.

DO_NOTHING
author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.DO_NOTHING)
If author is deleted. the related books will still have the deleted author ForeignKey reference.
Example: if the book related to author id = 1, if author is deleted. the ForeignKey reference still equal 1.

SET_DEFAULT
author = models.ForeignKey(Author, on_delete=models.SET_DEFAULT, default=1)
If the author is deleted. the related books will be bind with default id author.
Example: if the book related to author id = 2, if author id = 2 is deleted.
the ForeignKey reference will equal 1, so it will be binded with author id = 1.
