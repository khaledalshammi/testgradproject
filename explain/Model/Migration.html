--Migration--
After you build your tables in models file. You have to do 2 steps.
First step:
if you want to migrate all apps
python manage.py makemigrations
if you want to migrate particular app
python manage.py makemigrations app name
Second step:
python manage.py migrate
What are those steps?
makemigrations command will convert your models into database language as sql
for example:
class Person(models.Model):
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
    last_name = models.CharField(max_length=30)
Person Model will be convert it in Migration into those lines
CREATE TABLE myapp_person (
    "id" bigint NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY,
    "first_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL,
    "last_name" varchar(30) NOT NULL
);
migrate command will execute Migration files in database
Without migrate command your tables will not be exist in database until you perform migrate command.
