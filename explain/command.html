--Commands--

we use command to create data in database before run the website.
sometimes you want to have dummy data to watch data in database, command acheive that.
if you delete your database, all data will be deleted. to create dummy data.
you need to create it manually. if you build your command. you can run it again to have dummy data.
you can create and run commands by using the manage.py

Model:
class Client(models.Model):
    name = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name='Name')
    email = models.EmailField(unique=True)

class Car(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100, verbose_name='Title')
    client = models.ForeignKey(Client, on_delete=models.CASCADE)

create management folder then create commands folder.
