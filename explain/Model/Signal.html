--Signal--
Signals provide a way to allow decoupled applications to get notified when certain actions occur elsewhere in the application.
Signal has pre and post save.
pre: signal will implement before saving the object
post: signal will implement after saving the object

Examples:
1.
In following example, don't forget to configure your email in settings.py
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
from django.core.mail import send_mail

@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def send_welcome_email(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        subject = 'Welcome to our website!'
        message = 'Thank you for registering on our website.'
        from_email = 'admin@example.com'
        recipient_list = [instance.email]
        send_mail(subject, message, from_email, recipient_list)
signal will send email to the users after they registered.
It doesn'is not suitable to make it pre_signal because it doesn't make sense to send email to users before they register.


2.
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver
class UserActivityLog(models.Model):
    user = models.ForeignKey(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    activity = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)
def log_user_activity(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    activity = f"User {instance.user.username} performed {instance.activity}."
    UserActivityLog.objects.create(user=instance.user, activity=activity)
post_save.connect(log_user_activity, sender=UserActivityLog)

signal will be implemented after creating instance of UserActivityLog.
It's possible to use pre_save to modify the log entry just before it's saved.
@receiver(pre_save, sender=UserActivityLog)
def update_activity_message(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    instance.activity = f"User {instance.user.username} is about to perform {instance.activity}."


3.
from django.db import models
from django.contrib.auth.models import User
from django.db.models.signals import post_save
from django.dispatch import receiver

class UserProfile(models.Model):
    user = models.OneToOneField(User, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def create_user_profile(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
    if created:
        UserProfile.objects.create(user=instance)
@receiver(post_save, sender=User)
def save_user_profile(sender, instance, **kwargs):
    instance.userprofile.save()

Automatically create a user profile when a new user registers.
pre_save is not suitable because it's generally used to modify the fields of the current instance being saved.
To create a related profile automatically, post_save is more appropriate.


4.
class Client(models.Model):
    full_name = models.CharField(max_length=200, verbose_name="Full Name")
    slug_name = models.SlugField(max_length=222, verbose_name="Slug Name", blank=True, null=True)
    def __str__(self):
        return self.slug_name

@receiver(pre_save, sender=Client)
def handle_slug(sender, **kwargs):
    instance = kwargs['instance']
    instance.slug_name = slugify(instance.slug_name)

slugify the name before saving the instance.
