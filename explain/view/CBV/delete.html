--DeleteView--
built in class used to delete model object.

Model:
class Book(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField(max_length=100)
    available = models.BooleanField(default=False)


View:
from django.views.generic.edit import DeleteView
from django.urls import reverse
from app.models import Book
class BookDeleteView(DeleteView):
    model = Book # delete object of Book
    success_url = reverse('home')


Url:
from django.urls import path
from app.views import BookDeleteView
urlpatterns = [
    path('delete/<int:pk>/', BookDeleteView.as_view(), name='book-delete'),
]

Explanation: 
DeleteView handles deletion automatically.
If the deletion is valid, it will delete the object from the database and then redirect to the success_url.
